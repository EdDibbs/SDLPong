SDLPong
=======

A small SDL game based on Pong. This project is a side-project made in my spare time to get used to
using SDL for game programming, opposed to Allegro like I previously used.

To run this you need 
  SDL2  (http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
  
  and it's addons 
  
  SDL Image (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
